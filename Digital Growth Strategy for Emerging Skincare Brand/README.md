#  Digital Growth Strategy for Emerging Skincare Brand (D2C)

##  Project Summary
In mid-2020, I collaborated with a D2C skincare startup to establish a growth-focused digital strategy. The brand was in its pre-launch to early traction phase, and I was brought in to design a full-funnel system covering awareness, engagement, and lead capture across paid and organic channels.

##  Objective
- Build a digital foundation and brand narrative for launch  
- Drive initial traffic and interest via Meta Ads  
- Establish credibility with influencer-style content  
- Optimize lead generation and retargeting  
- Track performance and adjust creatives in real time

##  Tools & Platforms Used
- **Meta Ads Manager**  
- **Google Analytics**  
- **Google Sheets (Reporting & Budgeting)**  
- **Canva & Adobe Spark** (Visuals)  
- **Facebook Pixel**  
- **ChatGPT (for ad copy testing)**  
- **Instagram Insights**  

##  Key Highlights
- Created 3-phase Meta Ads funnel (awareness → interest → conversion)  
- Launched campaigns with **₹25 average CPL**, generating 500+ qualified leads  
- Set up UGC-style creatives that achieved **2.5% CTR** and high engagement  
- Implemented pixel-based retargeting strategy with 15% lower CPL  
- Built monthly reporting dashboard with actionable performance insights  
- Developed storytelling ad copy based on skincare pain points (acne, dryness, glow)

##  Key Deliverables
- Funnel structure and paid campaign roadmap  
- 10+ ad creatives in static, carousel, and story format  
- Ad copy variants tested with different tone/emotion  
- Visual consistency guide (color palette, post design, tone)  
- Lead form + nurture workflow for Instagram + WhatsApp  
- Weekly campaign performance reports with optimization plans

##  Notes

This was one of my most data-driven campaigns where **emotion-led ad copy**, **visual storytelling**, and **pixel precision** worked together. It also became a base framework I adapted for future e-commerce and wellness brands.
