# Instagram AI Chatbot for Spiritual Influencers

## Project Summary

I developed and deployed a custom **AI-powered chatbot system** for Instagram DMs, tailored for spiritual influencers offering Tarot, Spellcasting, and Energy Healing services. The goal was to automate lead qualification, nurture casual followers, and convert inquiries into paid sessions — all while maintaining a human, empathetic tone.

##  Objectives

- Reduce manual effort of responding to high DM volume  
- Qualify leads based on service interest, urgency, and price willingness  
- Create intelligent, emotionally-aligned replies using GPT-style prompts  
- Route hot leads to payment or booking pages with minimal friction

##  Tools & Tech Stack

- **Make.com** (Instagram webhook + automation flows)  
- **ChatGPT API** (intelligent response generation)  
- **Google Sheets** (lead tracking + history)  
- **Facebook Graph API** (for webhook & DM access)  
- **Tally.so** or **Calendly** (for lead form or booking flow)

##  Key Highlights

- Handled **100+ DM conversations daily** with zero human intervention  
- Achieved **22% conversion rate** from cold DMs to paid tarot/spell sessions  
- Reduced response time to under **5 seconds** with personalized replies  
- Enabled **segmentation**: curious visitors vs. ready-to-buy clients  
- Used NLP to detect user mood, urgency, and objections — and reply accordingly

##  Deliverables

- Complete Make.com chatbot flow  
- GPT prompt libraries tailored to different services (love, energy, finance, etc.)  
- Qualification logic & fallback handling  
- Real-time Google Sheet sync for lead analysis  
- DM response templates for edge cases (pricing, doubts, fake inquiries)

##  Notes

This system allowed spiritual entrepreneurs to scale their DM handling 24/7 without sounding robotic. The flow balanced automation with empathy — detecting when to respond playfully, when to upsell, and when to exit politely. It's now a base model I adapt across influencer funnels in the spiritual & coaching niches.
