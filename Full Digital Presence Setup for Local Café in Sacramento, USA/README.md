## 🧠 Project Summary
In early 2018, I worked with a small, family-owned café in Sacramento, California, to build their full digital presence from scratch. The café operated purely offline until that point, and the objective was to bring them online, increase local visibility, and drive foot traffic through targeted local SEO and social media presence.

## 🎯 Objective
- Establish a strong online presence for a completely offline business  
- Set up tools and platforms to help them attract and retain local customers  
- Rank for relevant Google search keywords related to cafes and breakfast spots in the region  
- Create basic brand consistency through content, visuals, and web presence

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech Used
- **WordPress** (for website development)  
- **Google My Business**  
- **Canva** (basic brand identity design – logo, menu)  
- **Google Search Console & Analytics**  
- **Yoast SEO plugin**  
- **Google Sheets** (content calendar)  

## 📈 Key Highlights
- Designed and launched a fully responsive WordPress website  
- Created GMB profile and got it verified for maps/local listing  
- Implemented on-page SEO strategy with focus on local search terms  
- Achieved **23 keyword rankings in Top 10 Google results** in 7 months  
- Designed social content templates to kickstart their Instagram and Facebook presence  
- Trained café staff on how to manage reviews and social DMs
