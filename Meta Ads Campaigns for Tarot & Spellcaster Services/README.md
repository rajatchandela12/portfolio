# 🔮 Meta Ads Campaigns for Tarot & Spellcaster Services

## 🧠 Project Summary
Designed and managed high-converting Meta (Facebook & Instagram) ad campaigns for multiple spiritual entrepreneurs — including tarot readers, spellcasters, and manifestation coaches. The objective was to generate direct DM conversations, build trust-based funnels, and ultimately convert leads into paid sessions.

The campaigns combined emotional copywriting, niche visuals, and automated DM scripts that guided users gently from interest to action, respecting the spiritual and personal tone of the services.
