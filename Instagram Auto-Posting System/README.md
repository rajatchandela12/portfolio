# 🤖 Instagram Auto-Posting System

## 🧠 Project Summary
Built a fully automated Instagram content scheduling and posting system for spiritual influencers and solopreneurs. The system allowed them to bulk-upload content into Google Sheets or Notion, automatically format captions, schedule posts, and publish to Instagram without manual effort — saving hours of repetitive work weekly.

It replicated the core function of tools like Buffer and Later, but with personalized flexibility and zero ongoing cost — built using Make.com, Google Drive, and unofficial Instagram API connectors.
