# AI-Based Product Photos & Video Automation for E-commerce Brands

## Project Summary
Built a scalable AI-driven creative system to generate high-quality product photos and promo videos for small-to-mid-sized e-commerce brands. This reduced their dependency on traditional photo shoots and enabled faster, cheaper campaign production.

The system allowed brands to upload raw product images (or provide basic info) and receive polished visuals like Instagram reels, carousels, and seasonal banners — powered by tools like Midjourney, DALL·E 3, Runway ML, and Canva API.

Clients could test more variations, respond faster to seasonal opportunities, and keep a strong visual identity without heavy overhead.
